**Paper: Deduction under Perturbed Evidence: Probing Student Simulation Capabilities of Large Language Models** 

You can find the paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14507).

DUPEd  StrategyQA can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/luffycodes/DUPEd_StrategyQA).

Please note that the QID which ends in either math_dupe/nlp_dupe refer to math/nlp perturbations respectively.

The QID can be mapped to original strategyQA dataset which can be downloaded [here](https://allenai.org/data/strategyqa).

Please note that the answer needs to be reversed for the facts.
It refers to the original answer field in the strategyqa dataset.
